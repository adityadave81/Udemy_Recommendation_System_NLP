This course is not part of my deep learning series, so it doesn't contain any hard math - just straight up coding in Python. All the materials for this course are FREE. After a brief discussion about what NLP is and what it can do, we will begin building very useful stuff. The first thing we'll build is a cipher decryption algorithm. These have applications in warfare and espionage. We will learn how to build and apply several useful NLP tools in this section, namely, character-level language models (using the Markov principle), and genetic algorithms.

These days, everyone seems to be talking about deep learning, but in fact there was a time when support vector machines were seen as superior to neural networks. One of the things you’ll learn about in this course is that a support vector machine actually is a neural network, and they essentially look identical if you were to draw a diagram. The toughest obstacle to overcome when you’re learning about support vector machines is that they are very theoretical. This theory very easily scares a lot of people away, and it might feel like learning about support vector machines is beyond your ability. Not so! In this course, we take a very methodical, step-by-step approach to build up all the theory you need to understand how the SVM really works.

The Bayesian approach is an alternative to the ""frequentist"" approach where one simply takes a sample of data and makes inferences about the likely parameters of the population. In contrast, the Bayesian approach uses both likelihood functions and a sample of observed data (the 'prior') to estimate the most likely values and distributions for the estimated population parameters (the 'posterior'). The course is useful to anyone who wishes to learn about Bayesian concepts and is suited to both novice and intermediate Bayesian students and Bayesian practitioners. It is both a practical, ""hands-on"" course with many examples using R scripts and software, and is conceptual, as the course explains the Bayesian concepts. All materials, software, R scripts, slides, exercises and solutions are included with the course materials. It is helpful to have some grounding in basic inferential statistics and probability theory. No experience with R is necessary, although it is also helpful. The course begins with an introductory section (12 video lessons) on using R and R 'scripting.' The introductory section is intended to introduce RStudio and R commands so that even a novice R user will be comfortable using R. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian Rule, with examples of both discrete and beta priors, predictive priors, and beta posteriors in Bayesian estimation. Section 3 explains and demonstrates the use of Bayesian estimation for single parameter models, for example, when one wishes to estimate the most likely value of a mean OR of a standard deviation (but not both). Section 4 explains and demonstrates the use of ""conjugate mixtures."" These are single-parameter models where the functional form of the prior and post are similar (for example, both normally distributed). But 'mixtures' imply there may be more than one component for the prior or posterior density functions. Mixtures enable the simultaneous test of competing, alternative theories as to which is more likely. Section 5 deals with multi-parameter Bayesian models where one is estimating the likelihood of more than one posterior variable value, for example, both mean AND standard deviation. Section 6 extends the Bayesian discussion by examining the estimation of integrals to estimate a probability. Section 7 covers the application the Bayesian approach to rejection and importance sampling and Section 8 looks at examples of comparing and validating Bayesian models.

You’ve probably heard about self-driving cars or applications that create new songs, poems, images and even entire movie scripts! The interesting thing about this is that most of these were built using neural networks. Neural networks have been used for a while, but with the rise of Deep Learning, they came back stronger than ever and now are seen as the most advanced technology for data analysis. One of the biggest problems that I’ve seen in students that start learning about neural networks is the lack of easily understandable content. This is due to the fact that the majority of the materials that are available are very technical and apply a lot of mathematical formulas, which simply makes the learning process incredibly difficult for whomever wishes to take their first steps in this field. With this in mind, the main objective of this course is to present the theoretical and mathematical concepts of neural networks in a simple yet thorough way, so even if you know nothing about neural networks, you’ll understand all the processes. We’ll cover concepts such as perceptrons, activation functions, multilayer networks, gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms, which form the foundations through which you will understand fully how a neural network is made. We’ll also cover the implementations on a step-by-step basis using Python, which is one of the most popular programming languages in the field of Data Science. It’s important to highlight that the step-by-step implementations will be done without using Machine Learning-specific Python libraries, because the idea behind this course is for you to understand how to do all the calculations necessary in order to build a neural network from scratch.

The course demonstrates the estimation of GLMs and GAMs by working through a series of practical examples from the book Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R by Simon N. Wood (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science, 2006). Linear statistical models have a univariate response modeled as a linear function of predictor variables and a zero mean random error term. The assumption of linearity is a critical (and limiting) characteristic. Generalized linear models (GLMs) relax this assumption of linearity. They permit the expected value of the response variable to be a smoothed (e.g. non-linear) monotonic function of the linear predictors. GLMs also relax the assumption that the response variable is normally distributed by allowing for many distributions (e.g. normal, poisson, binomial, log-linear, etc.). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are extensions of GLMs. GAMs allow for the estimation of regression coefficients that take the form of non-parametric smoothers. Nonparametric smoothers like lowess (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) fit a smooth curve to data using localized subsets of the data. This course provides an overview of modeling GLMs and GAMs using R. GLMs, and especially GAMs, have evolved into standard statistical methodologies of considerable flexibility. The course addresses recent approaches to modeling, estimating and interpreting GAMs. The focus of the course is on modeling and interpreting GLMs and especially GAMs with R. Use of the freely available R software illustrates the practicalities of linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models.

But it’s only now—more than six decades later—that AI is expected to revolutionize the way humanity will live and work in the coming decades. Data science is a large field of study that covers data systems and processes. These systems and processes are aimed at maintaining data sets as well as getting meaning out of them.

When we first got started in Deep Learning particularly in Computer Vision, we were really excited at the possibilities of this technology to help people. The only problem is, that image classification and object detection runs just fine on our expensive, power consuming and bulky Deep Learning machines. However, not everyone can afford or implement AI for their practical applications. This is when we went searching for an affordable, compact, less power hungry alternative. Generally if we'd want to shrink our IoT and automation projects, we'd often look to the Raspberry Pi which is versatile computing solution for numerous problems. This made us ponder about how we can port out deep learning models to this compact computing unit. Not only that, but how could we run it at close to real-time? Amongst the possible solutions we arrived at using the raspberry pi in conjunction with an AI Accelerator USB stick that was made by Intel to boost our object detection frame-rate. However it was not so simple to get it up and running. Implementing the documentation, we landed up with a series of bugs after bugs, which became a bit tedious.
