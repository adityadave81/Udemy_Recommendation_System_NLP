# Udemy_Recommendation_System_NLP

## This is the final project I did for Web Mining class at Pace University. In this project, I used Selenium and BeautifulSoup to Web Scrape more than 2000 Data Science courses from Udemy. Used Cosine Similarity in order to create a Recommendation System that takes course Description as input in order to recommend similar courses. 

## I am not including the code for Web Scraping and instead uploading the final DataFrame due to Udemy's policy.
